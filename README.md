# Aneurysm Segmentation with nnU-net through various losses 
Intracranial Aneurysm Segmentation with nnU-net: Investigating Hybrid Loss Functions

Our work focuses on investigating the impact of different hybrid loss functions, incorporating both distribution-based and region-based losses, on the segmentation performance.
